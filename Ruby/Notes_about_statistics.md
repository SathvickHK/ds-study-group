# Terminology

### Location terminology
With this we mean the location of the data point within the the distribution in the dataset.
- **Mean**: The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
- **Weighted mean**: The sum of all values times a weight divided by the sum of the weights.
- **Median**: The value such that one-half of the data lies above and below.
- **Weighted median**: The value such that one-half of the sum of the weights lies above and below the sorted data.
- **Trimmed mean**: The average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values.
- **Robust**: Not sensitive to extreme values.
- **Outlier**: A data value that is very different from most of the data.

**Note**: Percentiles (50%,25%,75%) refer to all the points from the minimum (smallest in the dataset), to it.

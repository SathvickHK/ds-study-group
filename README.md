## Motivation
In order to fully grasp the concepts of Data Science (Often referred to as **DS** from now on), we will have to track our projects and our resources in this repository.
The key of doing that is:
- It helps us stay accountable by regularly updating the repository.
- It teaches us the basics of Git & GitHub
- It gives others the opportunity to jump in during this proccess and join us along the wayðŸ™‚. 

# Our Paths
We'll have a roadmap based on the one published on  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-science-learning-roadmap/), this entails the following sections:
## Git:
We will be doing a quick overview of everything Git.
- [https://www.atlassian.com/git](https://www.atlassian.com/git)
- [https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)
- [Git Cheat Sheet by GitHub](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- [Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
- Comfort using the Terminal, version control in Git, and using GitHub

#### GitHub
- [https://skills.github.com](https://skills.github.com/)

## SQL

- [course on SQL and Databases](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-and-databases-full-course/)Â 

- [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql)Â andÂ [Advanced SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/advanced-sql)Â on Kaggle.

- freeCodeCamp now has aÂ [free interactive SQL course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

## Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics**â€Š - summarize data

- Measures of central tendency
- Measures of variance
- Frequency histogram and distribution
- Frequency table and stem-and-leaf
- Percentile and box-and-whisker plots

**Inferential statistics**â€Š - infer insights about samples to population

- Sampling
- Experimental design
- Randomization
- hypothesis tests
- A/B tests
- confidence interval
- p-value
- alpha values
- t-tests
- degrees of freedom
- ANOVA
- covariance and correlation

- Scatter diagrams and linear correlation
- Normal distribution and empirical rule
- Z-score and probabilities
- Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem

 - TBD

## Programming
- Data structures
    - data types
    - lists
    - dictionaries
    - sets
    - tuples
- writing functions
- logic and control flow
- searching and sorting algorithms
- object-oriented programming

---
- We have to cover our bases here, so we'll be updating this once we find a reliable and good source to teach Python.
